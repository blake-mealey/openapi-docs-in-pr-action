# OpenAPI Review Action

A GitHub action for reviewing changes to your OpenAPI specs.

This action posts a comment to your PR whenever you make a change to an OpenAPI spec file, with
helpful details for your reviewers to catch more potential problems and give better feedback!

- Review your spec's diff to make sure you aren't introducing breaking changes for your users
- Make sure your API's docs are complete and up to snuff before accepting a change

âš¡ Powered by [openapi-diff](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/openapi-diff) and
